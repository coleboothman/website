						<p> I am a third year Computer Science student specializing in Software Engineering at the University of Victoria. I enjoy front-end web development, design and working on my own coding projects. When I am not studying or programming I enjoy playing the piano, going to the gym and reading in my spare time. I like working in team environments and working together to design optimized, quality software. </p>

						<p id = "para2"> My goal as a future Software Developer is to build safe, relevant, quality software in a timely and orderly manner. Being a programmer means that you never stop learning about aspects of languages, coding and working together with other engineers to form a unique solution. I hope to use my diverse skill set and creative drive for software application development in the near future. </p>
