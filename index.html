						<p> I am a third year Computer Science student specializing in Software Engineering at the University of Victoria. I enjoy front-end web development, design and working on my own coding projects. When I am not studying or programming I enjoy playing the piano, going to the gym and reading in my spare time. I like working in team environments and working together to design optimized, quality software. </p>

						<p id = "para2"> My goal as a future Software Developer is to build safe, relevant, quality software in a timely and orderly manner. Being a programmer means that you never stop learning about aspects of languages, coding and working together with other engineers to form a unique solution. I hope to use my diverse skill set and creative drive for software application development in the near future. </p>

				<h1 id = "battle-title"> BattleSnake.io Programming Competition </h1>
				<p> <a href="http://www.battlesnake.io/"> BattleSnake.io </a> is an annual programming competition where participants team up and create 'Snake' AI's to compete against each other in an online version of the video game "Snake". <a href="https://github.com/LouisRitchie/battlesnake-python"> Our AI </a> which was programmed using Python made it to the semifinals.
				<h1 id = "commenter-title"> Commenter </h1>
				<p> Commenter is a one page messaging site implemented with HTML and CSS as well as Javascript/Jquery for the backend. People can post their thoughts which go down below for others to see. </p>
				<h1 id = "starship-title"> Starship Invaders </h1> 
				<p> Starship Invaders is a 2D 'space invaders' style game I created using Java and Photoshop for creating pixel images. This was my first time figuring out how video games use ticks to measure time and how to create and optimize FPS in video game. I enjoyed creating and customizing many classes for enemies AI's, Players and shooting bullets. </p> 	 
				<h1 id = "draw-title"> SEng 265Draw Program </h1>
				<p> <a href="https://github.com/coleboothman/265Draw"> 265Draw </a> is an application created in my Software Engineering 265 class. Working as a team, we created simple line and point classes in Python/C++ and wrote a converter which takes lines/points and turns them into svg files, which can be dragged into the browser to display an image, (ie. a Square). With a few tweaks, I managed to add classes so we could create "Pursuit" Polygons, which creates the optical illusion of a repeated twist to all Polygons. </p>
				<h1 id = "website-title"> This Website </h1>
				<p> This website is my first attempt at web design. I programmed and designed it using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap Framework. It's been a huge learning curve but I am proud to display my work to you and grateful to have learned alot about designing and optimizing websites. </p>
